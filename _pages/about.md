I am a PhD Candidate in the [Dept. of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University working with [David B. Dunson](https://www.daviddunson.com/). Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection between Bayesian Inference and Probabilistic Machine Learning.
Currently, I am working on Bayesian Factor Models for High-dimensional data and Nonparametric Density Estimation. 

Prior to Duke, I completed a MSc in Data Science at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home), where I was a member of the [BayesLab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/) and was advised by [Giacomo Zanella](https://sites.google.com/site/gzanellawebpage/home), with a thesis on stochastic gradient MCMC.
